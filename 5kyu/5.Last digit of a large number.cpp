/*
5.Last digit of a large number

Instructions

Define a function that takes in two non-negative integers a and b and 
returns the last decimal digit of a^b . Note that a and b may be very large!

For example, the last decimal digit of 9^7 is 9, since 9^7= 47829699 . 
The last decimal digit of (2^200)2^300, which has over 10^92 decimal digits, 
is 6. Also, please take 0^0 to be 1.

You may assume that the input will always be valid.

Remarks
JavaScript, C++, R, PureScript
Since these languages don't have native arbitrarily large integers, 
your arguments are going to be strings representing non-negative integers instead.
